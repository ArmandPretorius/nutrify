Description of Nutrify:

For our term 3 project we were tasked to create a application that can help the user in regards
to their health. I decided to create a app that will help the user eat healthier and know what
they are putting into their bodies. 

Nutrify helps you "nutrify" your food by telling you the nutrients of your food. It gives you the
food's amount of energy, calories, fibre, fat and protein. After that you can search recipes that
contain those food. You see all the ingredients in the recipe, and also the same nutrients.

How to use Nutrify:

When opening the app, you are taken to the search page, where you enter the food you want to analize.
The food can be anything from an apple to a Big Mac. The app will nutrify your food, giving you the
nutrients in the food. 
From there, you can choose to search for recipes containing the food you nutrified.
You get a list of recipes with each recipe showing an image, the recipe name, the time it takes to
prepare and the amount of calories in the dish. When selecting a recipe, you can view the ingridients
of the recipe and also the amount of nutrients in the dish.

How does Nutrify work:

The app is programmed using Xamarin.Forms with C# handling the logic.
For a backend, Nutrify uses Edamam's Food and Recipe API containing all the nutrients of the food.

At the moment the App is only available on Android. The target operating system version is from 
Oreo 5.1 to Pie 9.

Changes made and missing elements:

- I still need to add the ability to save recipes to your device for later viewing in a "recipe 
  book".
- I'd also like to add the ability to share a recipe with your friends on WhatsApp, email etc.
